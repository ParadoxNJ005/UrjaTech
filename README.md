This Flutter-based mobile app, powered by Firebase, is designed to promote sustainable waste management through recycling and renewable energy generation. Users can track their recycling efforts, earn rewards like energy credits, and participate in a circular economy that turns waste into energy. The app leverages waste sorting and integrates with local waste-to-energy plants for efficient processing.
